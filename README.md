This project is a toolkit for working with JSON in Scala that is based on
[example code](http://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_2ed/examples/)
from [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed)
by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners. We've tightened up some edge
cases and added complete test coverage.
